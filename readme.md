1. Why Rust
    - Rust uses compiler
    - High performance as c
    - garbage collection not necessary
    - concurrent programming
    - easy to understand errors
    - requires less memmory

2. install ructc and cargo
    - sudo apt install cargo (installs both compiler and package manager)
    - remove rust
        - sudo apt remove cargo
        - sudo apt autoremove

3. create new cargo(rust) app
    - cargo new [app_name]

4. Package Manager
    - crates.io
